# Approach Explanation for Persona-Driven Document Intelligence

## Overview

Our solution for extracting structured outlines (Title, H1, H2, H3) from PDFs employs a sophisticated hybrid approach that combines rule-based heuristics with machine learning classification. This methodology enables robust document structure detection across diverse document types and languages while maintaining high accuracy and fast processing speeds suitable for real-time applications.

## Key Components

**1. Multi-layered Feature Extraction**: We extract rich features from each text block including font properties (size, weight, family), positional information (indentation, page location), content characteristics (capitalization patterns, numbering schemes), and document-relative metrics (font size ratios, spacing patterns). This comprehensive feature set captures both visual and semantic indicators of document hierarchy.

**2. Hybrid Classification System**: Our approach uses a two-stage classification process where rule-based heuristics provide initial predictions with confidence scores, followed by a machine learning classifier (Random Forest) that handles ambiguous cases. The hybrid decision engine intelligently combines these predictions based on confidence levels, using rules for high-confidence cases and ML for uncertain scenarios.

**3. Multilingual and Cross-format Adaptability**: The system is designed to handle various document formats and languages by relying on universal visual cues rather than language-specific text analysis. Font hierarchy, indentation patterns, and positional information remain consistent across languages, making our approach robust for international document processing.

**4. Optimized Performance Pipeline**: The entire system is optimized for CPU-only execution with efficient memory usage and vectorized feature computation, ensuring sub-10-second processing for documents up to 50 pages while maintaining model sizes under 200MB.

## Rationale

This hybrid approach addresses the key challenges in document structure extraction: the variability in document formatting styles and the need for high accuracy across diverse document types. Rule-based systems excel at capturing explicit formatting patterns but struggle with edge cases, while pure ML approaches require extensive training data and may overfit to specific document styles. Our hybrid methodology leverages the strengths of both approaches, using rules for clear-cut cases and ML for nuanced decisions, resulting in a robust system that generalizes well across different document types while maintaining high processing speeds required for production deployment.
